# Email Spam Classifier (MLOps Practice Project)

This is a **practice project** created while learning **MLOps** concepts such as data versioning, pipeline creation, and experiment tracking using **DVC** and **Git**.

##  Goal

Build a simple machine learning pipeline to classify emails as spam or not spam, and integrate MLOps tools like:

- ✅ DVC (for tracking data, models, and experiments)
- ✅ Git (for version control)
- ✅ params.yaml (to manage configurations)
-
